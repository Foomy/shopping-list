Shopping List
=============

Nice little applicaton for managing a shopping list.

Short user guide:

1. Add items using your favorite Browser on the plattform you want.
2. Go to the supermarket.
3. Read your shopping list using your smartphone browser.
4. If it's in your shopping cart, remove item from the list by clicking on it.
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until your shopping list is empty or your shopping cart is full.
   (Even stop, if supermarket is empty, of course.)
